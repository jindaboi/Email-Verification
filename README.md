# Email-Verification
This is a very small python console tool that allows users to chekc if an email address is valid. It uses an API from Rapid API called "Email Verifier" that connects to that email address and checks of it is a real or fake address.

This tool will helps prevent users clicking on emails that are fake and potentially access the users' computer. 

I made this simple tool due to the high volumes of emails I was receiving and needed some sort of verification tool to protect my computer.

To use:

Open up an run the application and follow the prompts, the tool will then print out the information via the console. 

Enjoy!
